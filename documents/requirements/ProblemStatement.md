# House Rental Management System


House rental management system is a web-based system where house owners(landlords) and customers can exchange information effectively and inexpensively. This system provides a user-friendly interface, satisfying the needs of the consumers. 

It allows admins to manage landlords and all other users of the system. It also allows owners and customers to register. Landlord (owner) is the user who owns the property and wants to give it for rent/sale. 

The system should allow owner to upload all the details of the property such as the number of rooms, price, location etc. and allow them to manage it (to un list or edit). The owner should display their properties by price, by location and by number of rooms. Customer is the one who is looking for a property. She/He can search the properties according to the requirements. The viewer (unregistered customer) is the user who can only search and display properties. Customers can filter properties by price, property type, number of rooms, and by location. 

Registered users should be able to apply for properties through the system, and the owner will be notified.
